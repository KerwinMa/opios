Thank you for downloading Hookflash's Open Peer iOS SDK.

Prebuilt sdk version and sample application project you can download from this here: http://openpeer.org/open-peer-sdk-for-ios/
In case you download SampleApplicationWithSDK(...).zip, unpack it, open /Samples/OpenPeerSampleApp/OpenPeerSampleApp.xcodeproj and hit run.

This release is a 1.0.15 release of the SDK and Hookflash will be publishing updates to the SDK regularly.

For a quick introduction to build the code, downloaded from github,  please read the following. For more detailed instructions please go to http://docs.hookflash.com.


From your terminal, please clone the "opios" git repository:
git clone --recursive https://github.com/openpeer/opios.git

This repository will yield the iOS Object-C SDK, sample application and dependency librarys like the C++ open peer core, stack, media and libraries needed to support the underlying SDK.

Directory structure:
opios/                            - contains the project files for building the Open Peer iOS SDK framework
opios/openpeer-ios-sdk/           - contains the Open Peer iOS SDK header files
opios/openpeer-ios-sdk/source/    - contains the implementation of the iOS SDK header files
opios/openpeer-ios-sdk/internal/  - contains the wrapper interface that implements the Objective-C to C++ interaction
opios/Samples/                    - contains the Open Peer iOS Samples application(s)

How to build:

0) If you haven't installed xcode command line tools so far, please go to Xcode->Preferences->Downloads and download command line tools.
	Also before calling "prepare.sh", please make sure to remove any file called "user-config.jam" from your HOME directory. If this file is present, the file can conflict with boost building properly on your system.

For example:
cp ~/user-config.jam user-config.jam.save
rm ~/user-config.jam

1) Prepare dvelopment environment by running prepare.sh script from your terminal:

pushd opios/
./prepare.sh
popd


2) From X-code, load sdk project:

opios/SampleWithSDK.xcworkspace

3) Select OpenPeerSDK scheme and make a build. This will build framework with debug symbols and save it in the opios/ folder. To make a production framework run archiving.

4) After OpenPeerSDK is successfully built, select OpenPeerSampleApp project and update following files:

	CustomerSpecific.plist (this file is added in git.ignore)
		applicationId = @"<-- insert application ID here (e.g. com.domain.appName) -->";
		applicationIdSharedSecret = @"<-- insert shared secret here -->"; (Get it from the https://fly.hookflash.me/apps)
		applicationName = @"<-- enter application name here (e.g. OpenPeerSampleApp) -->";
		applicationImageURL = @"<-- enter application image url (e.g. http://hookflash.com/wp-content/themes/CleanSpace/images/logo.png) -->";
		applicationURL = @"<-- enter application url (e.g. www.openpeer.org) -->";

	DefaultSettings.plist (this file contains valid settings that can be used until you set your developer environment)
		outerFrameURL = @"<-- enter outer frame url here (e.g. https://app-javascript.hookflash.me/outer.html?view=choose) -->";
		namespaceGrantServiceURL = @"<-- enter outer namespace grant service url here (e.g. https://app-javascript.hookflash.me/outernamespacegrant.html) -->";
		identityProviderDomain = @"<-- enter identity provider domain here (e.g. idprovider-javascript.hookflash.me) -->";
		identityFederateBaseURI = @"<-- enter federated identity base uri here (e.g. identity://idprovider-javascript.hookflash.me/) -->";
		lockBoxServiceDomain =  @"<-- enter lockbox service domain here (e.g. hcs-javascript.hookflash.me) -->";
		defaultOutgoingTelnetServer = @"<-- enter outgoing telnet server here (e.g. tcp.logger.hookflash.me:8055) -->";
		localTelnetLoggerPort = @"<-- enter outgoing telnet server here (e.g. 59999) -->";
		
		
	If you want to change your application data or login settings, you can create a QR code with URL of json file(e.g. www.my_test_server.com/settings.json) that contains desired data. 
	JSON file format is: 
	
	
	{"root":
		{
			"outerFrameURL": "<-- enter outer frame url here (e.g. https://app-javascript.hookflash.me/outer.html?view=choose) -->",
			"identityProviderDomain": "<-- enter identity provider domain here (e.g. idprovider-javascript.hookflash.me) -->",
			"identityFederateBaseURI": "<-- enter federated identity base uri here (e.g. identity://idprovider-javascript.hookflash.me/) -->",
			"namespaceGrantServiceURL": "<-- enter outer namespace grant service url here (e.g. https://app-javascript.hookflash.me/outernamespacegrant.html) -->",
			"lockBoxServiceDomain": "<-- enter lockbox service domain here (e.g. hcs-javascript.hookflash.me) -->",
			"defaultOutgoingTelnetServer": "<-- enter outgoing telnet server here (e.g. tcp.logger.hookflash.me:8055) -->"
			"localTelnetLoggerPort": "<-- enter outgoing telnet server here (e.g. 59999) -->";
		}
	}
	
	

5) Now you can hit the run on OpenPeerSampleApp scheme
